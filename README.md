# Arduino MacroPad Library

This library enables the Arduino to control the MacroPad (keyboard).

This library only handles key input and manages macros, so you need any HID library to use it as a HID. (e.g. [Keyboard library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Keyboard))

This is written for the Raspberry Pi Pico, but should work with all Arduino boards.
